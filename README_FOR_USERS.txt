## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Windows protected your PC" message
1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**
   
This happens because the app isn't digitally signed. It's safe - you built it yourself!

### Application won't start
1. Make sure you extracted ALL files from the ZIP
2. Keep `DocShot.exe` in the same folder with other files
3. Try running as Administrator (right-click → Run as Administrator)

### Can't capture screenshots
1. Close other screen capture tools
2. Try clicking the Capture button instead of using hotkey
3. Grant screen recording permissions if asked

### Error messages
Check the log file:
```
C:\Users\YourName\overlay_annotator_logs\
```
